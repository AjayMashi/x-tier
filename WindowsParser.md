# Overview #
The X-TIER parser for Windows drivers is capable of transforming 32-bit Windows driver files (**.sys) to the [X-Format](XFormat.md).**

# Prerequisites #
In order to use the X-TIER parser for Windows, we first have to obtain the relative offsets of the individual external functions that the Windows kernel provides:
  1. Start the Windows virtual machine that you want to inject modules in.
  1. Save the `C:\System32\ntoskrnl.exe` file of the Windows virtual machine to a directory of your choice.
  1. Locate the Windows kernel binary in memory with [LiveKd](http://technet.microsoft.com/de-de/sysinternals/bb897415.aspx)
    1. Start LiveKd
    1. Type "!pcr" to obtain the KPCR
    1. display the KPCR with "dt _KPCR <address from step 1)>"
    1. Display KdVersionBlock with "dt_DBGKD\_GET\_VERSION64 <address from step 2)>"
  1. Save the Windows kernel image with the QEMU monitor
```
(qemu) memsave <address of kernel base> 0x10000000 "/tmp/ntos.bin"
```
  1. Use the `offsetExtractor.py` (`X-TIER/parser/win/`) that comes with X-TIER to extract the relative addresses of the external functions. To do this, the `OffsetExtractor` must be placed into the same directory as `Å†toskrnl.exe` and `ntos.bin`, before it is executed. Alternatively, you also can change the `offsetExtractor.py` script.

# Usage #
In the following the arguments that can be provided to the parser are listed and explained.

```

peparser.py <driver>

         <driver>        The complete path to the Windows driver (*.sys) that should be parsed.
```

# Example #
```
$ ./peparser.py modules.sys
```

# Output #
```
         PEparser
